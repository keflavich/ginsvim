ginsvim
=======

My `.vim` directory and `.vimrc`.  I made a readme because I liked the one at https://github.com/jonathansick/sickvim.  I think I used pathogen to install something once, but I'm really not sure... I really like to use `git clone` and `cp -r` for my various installs.  As with `https://github.com/keflavich/configfiles`, there's a branch for each computer.  I'm using `jedi` for vim now, but I haven't tested it much.  Should record all installs here instead of... haphazardly, as I have been doing.
